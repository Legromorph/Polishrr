WILL WORK ON RENAMING THIS TO arr-cf-search IN THE NEAR FUTURE...

This is a small python script to look through files in Radarr and Sonarr and try to upgrade files if they have not met your custom format score yet.

1. copy example_env to .env and update the variables inside
2. copy docker compose example
3. make sure the .env file is in your mapped volume for /config
4. docker compose up -d
